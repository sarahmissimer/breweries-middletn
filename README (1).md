# If there is beer... Will they come? Build? Live?

This question is what sparked my interest, and the interest of my friends, while sitting at a brewery in one of our favorite neighborhoods.
Nashville is a booming city from any side you look at it. Knowing this, growth is happening in all neighborhoods whether there is a brewery or not. What I want this data analysis to show is the correlation between the growth of a neighborhood with the establishment of a brewery. 
This project dives into the population of each neighborhood, captures housing value trends, gathers commercial and residential building permits requested and issued all before and after the establishment of a brewery. 
Itâ€™s my belief that if there is beer, they will come, build and live. 

### Motivation
As a native Nashvillian, I have seen quite a bit of growth over the years. 
I have seen areas once known for abandoned buildings and parking lots blossom into beautiful, hip neighborhoods. Looking at you, Gulch. I have seen neighborhoods on the brink of extinction revitalize into melting pots of food, music and shopping. All eyes on you, Houston Street. From when I was young to now, even Broadway has changed its tune.
And one thing I have noticed most about these thriving neighborhoods in Nashville - once I turned 21 and developed a love of craft beer - is: a majority of them have a brewery (if not 5 *cough 37209 cough*) established within their zip code. 

## Project Question
**Do craft breweries bring growth to neighborhoods?**

Growth is defined by an increase in:
- population
- income
- housing value
